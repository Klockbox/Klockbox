- Hello! I'm Darius! I am currently studying for my second bachelor's degree in Game Design at the DE:Hive of the University of Applied Sciences Berlin.
- I'm a new game dev with a special interest in gameplay programming and narrative design and have been a long time fan of tabletop role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons, which I have played weekly for over 3 years now.
- Currently I am working on a small scale first person mech action game called Brass Bull to dive deeper into Unreal Engine 5. If you're interested, you can follow my devlog on youtube under youtube.com/@DariusFolly.
- You can find me and an extensive portfolio of my projects on LinkedIn under: linkedin.com/in/dariusbergmann
